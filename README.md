# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Quantitative cellular description of gastric slow wave activity.**   
Corrias A, Buist ML. _Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol_ 2008

**Abstract:**   
Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are responsible for the spontaneous and
omnipresent electrical activity in the stomach. A quantitative description of
the intracellular processes whose coordinated activity is believed to generate
electrical slow waves has been developed and is presented here. In line with
recent experimental evidence, the model describes how the interplay between
the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum in cycling intracellular Ca(2+)
provides the primary regulatory signal for the initiation of the slow wave.
The major ion channels that have been identified as influencing slow wave
activity have been modeled according to data obtained from isolated ICC. The
model has been validated by comparing the simulated profile of the slow waves
with experimental recordings and shows good correspondence in terms of
frequency, amplitude, and shape in both control and pharmacologically altered
conditions.
